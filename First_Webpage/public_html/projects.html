            <em><strong> About: </strong></em> This course introduces and provides 
            a framework for the design process, problem solving and project 
            management. Students are introduced to communication as an integral 
            component of engineering practice. The course is a vehicle for 
            understanding problem solving and developing communications skills. 
            Building on the first course, this second course in the two 
            Engineering Strategies and Practice course sequence introduces 
            students to project management and to design problem definition. 
            Students work in teams on a term length design project. Students 
            will write a series of technical reports and give a team based design 
            project presentation.
        </p>

            <em><strong> Engineering Design Process: </strong></em>We first used a 
            functional decomposition to determine the project's main functions. For
            each function, we came up with a list of solutions. Combining these solutions,
            we developed a list of 25 complete ideas. To narrow the list, we compared each idea
            to the project's two most important objectives in an objective comparison graph. The top
            five ideas were then compared using a weighted decision matrix to help us determine which
            design to proceed with.
        </p>

            <em><strong> Responsibilities: </strong></em> As team leader, I held many responsibilities.
            These included arranging meetings outside of the scheduled tutorials, communicating with our client
            with regards to meetings and project updates, ensuring meetings stay focused and productive, and 
            upholding a positive and effective team dynamic.

            <em><strong> About: </strong></em> I taught myself html, css, and javascript
            using online tutorials and resources. To practice these skills, I decided 
            to create my own personal business website. Upon completing the code, I 
            researched web hosting options and used a free web hosting server to deploy 
            and publish my website on.
